    <h4>plant disease detection using ML Techniques</h4>
    <img src="./leaf_disease.jpeg" height=200/>
    <ul>
        <li>Collected images of diseased plants of various species, performed ImageDataGeneration for generation of images with different orientation, contrast adjustment.</li>
        <li>Successfully created 4 Convolutional Neural Networks (resnet50,InceptionV3,resnet152V2,VGG19) using Transfer-Learning, given leaf images as input to all CNN models resulted in classification based on type of illness.</li>
        <li>Achieved 98.21% accuracy for the inceptionV3 model, deployed in the website backend using Flask API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cursor-Movement-By-Hand-Gesture Using OpenCV</h4>
    <img src="./hand_guesture.jpg" height=200 />    
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a hand gesture mouse control system using Python libraries like cv2, mediapipe, and pyautogui.</li>
        <li>Leveraged cv2, mediapipe for hand tracking and gesture recognition, while pyautogui was utilized for assigning functionality.</li>
        <li>Implemented a real-time interface allowing users to interact with the computer through hands-free control experience.</li>
    </ul>
